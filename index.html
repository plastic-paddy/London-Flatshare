With a population of over 7 million people, <b>London</b> is not only the biggest city in Britain but in the whole of Europe. What sets London apart from other cities is the fact that it covers a massive 620 square miles and as a consequence offers numerous distinct areas and boroughs. As a result of its sheer size and variation combined with high rental costs, finding a flatshare in London can be quite challenging and requires research and insider knowledge.
</p>

<p>
<b>The area:</b><br>
London is best seen as a magnificent set of smaller parts making up the vast whole; it is split into Central, North, West, South and East London, each with their own boroughs full of unique character to suit all budgets, from Westminster to Shoreditch.
</p>

<p>
For example, once regarded as the ‘poor end of town’, East London is now a thriving multi-cultural area that covers boroughs as diverse as Bethnal Green, Hackney and Poplar. The centre for much of the London Olympics 2012, the ‘East End’ has enjoyed significant regeneration and as a direct result is fast becoming the location of choice for <a href="http://uk.easyroommate.com/Professional-Flatshare/south-east/london/east-london/wapping-flatshare">professionals seeking a flatshare close to Wapping</a>.
